* GitHub Enterprise Pre-receive Hook Sandbox Environment

GitHub Enterprise imposes certain additional requirements on running
server-side pre-receive hooks.

1. The hook has a strict 5 second time limit in which to run.
2. The hook must run within a sandboxed environment, which only lives
   for the duration of the hook running. The default does not work for
   Captain Git Hook because it does not include dirmngr.

A suitable sandbox is specified in [[./Dockerfile]]. You can build this
Dockerfile into an appropriate tarball for upload to GitHub using the
script [[./create-github-pre-receive-environment.sh]].

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # run this in the same directory as this readme
  cd github

  # this produces capn-pre-receive.tar.gz
  ./create-github-pre-receive-environment.sh
  
  # you can now upload the tarball to GitHub
#+END_SRC

The following two documents show how to set up this sandbox
environment on GitHub:
